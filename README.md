# GitAutoInit

GitAutoInit is a simple & easy script that helps with git repo initialization and github repo importing. 

## Operating Systems

The script is currently available only in MacOS and other Unix based OS that contain the Bash Shell. 

## Requirements

Github CLI must be installed in your computer for the script to work

## Usage

Download the `gitautoinit.sh` script and run `bash gitautoinit.sh`. Follow the setup instructions and you're done! 

As a general recommendation, place the `gitautoinit.sh` script into `usr/local/bin`, as MacOS has it in the PATH by default, or create a `bin` folder in your home directory and add it to the PATH. Specific instructions can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40010094)
